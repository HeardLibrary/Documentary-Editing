# Documentary Editing

How do scholars represent manuscript and printed sources in the digital age? In this course, students will produce scholarly editions using the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). After exploring our collections to identify a relevant manuscript or printed source, they will interview specialists and stakeholders to determine the best way to represent both its intellectual content and physical structure. Students will undertake digital editions, exploring the differences between digital facsimiles, diplomatic editions, and critical editions. By the conclusion of the course, students will be able to produce digital editions conforming to the MLA's Guidelines for Editors of Scholarly Editions. Lead mentor: Cliff Anderson and Ramona Romero.
